# Deep Learning Based LIDAR Perception for Road Users Recognition

Despite the numerous traffic signals, crosswalks and pedestrian safety signage, the number of accidents on highways and urban areas, between cars and pedestrians, is sadly very high. Thus, the development of advanced perception systems1 for intelligent vehicles (IV) and autonomous vehicles (AV) [14, 20, 26, 69, 55] is a promising step forward to drastically reduce the number of road accidents, knowing that the perception is the process in which an intelligent vehicle interprets the sensor data, in order to understand the world around it and thus, allowing decision-making in an optimized and secure way. However, sensory perception is not a trivial task, especially when it comes to pedestrian detection, because a personâ€™s appearance depends on lighting, clothing, body articulation and may suffers of occlusion. Recently, because of the vulnerability, safety, social and economic impact, pedestrian perception systems have been the focus of many studies involving intelligent vehicles [45, 2, 16, 50].

In this way, the growing field related to the advanced perception for intelligent/autonomous vehicles (IV/AV), aggregating knowledge from several areas, such as electrical engineering, mechatronics, computing, statistics, and ML/AI, has been achieved very promising and encouraging results for vision-based perception for intelligent vehicles [31, 44, 8, 9, 21]. In perception systems, objects are categories or classes to be detected or classified, such as pedestrians, cars, vans, and cyclists, which may be contained in the field of view of sensors (i.e. cameras, radars, LIDARs).

# CNN-LIDAR pedestrian classification: combining range and reflectance data

Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8519497

The use of multiple sensors in perception systems is becoming a consensus in the automotive and robotics industries. Camera is the most popular technology, however, radar and LIDAR are increasingly being adopted more often in protection and safety systems for object/obstacle detection. In this paper, we particularly explore the LIDAR sensor as an inter-modality technology which provides two types of data, range (distance) and reflectance (intensity return), and study the influence of high-resolution distance/depth (DM) and reflectance maps (RM) on pedestrian classification using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Pedestrian protection is critical for advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and it has regained particular attention recently for known reasons. In this work, CNN-LIDAR based pedestrian classification is studied in three distinct cases: (i) having a single modality as input in the CNN, (ii) by combining distance and reflectance measurements at the CNN input-level (early fusion), and (iii) combining outputs scores from two single-modal CNNs (late fusion). Distance and intensity (reflectance) raw data from LIDAR are transformed to high-resolution (dense) maps which allow a direct implementation on CNNs both as single or multi-channel inputs (early fusion approach). In terms of late-fusion, the outputs from individual CNNs are combined by means of non-learning rules, such as: minimum, maximum, average, product. Pedestrian classification is evaluated on a 'binary classification' dataset created from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, and results are shown for the three cases.


# Multimodal CNN Pedestrian Classification: A Study on Combining LIDAR and Camera Data

Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8569666

This paper presents a study on pedestrian classification based on deep learning using data from a monocular camera and a 3D LIDAR sensor, separately and in combination. Early and late multi-modal sensor fusion approaches are revisited and compared in terms of classification performance. The problem of pedestrian classification finds applications in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and it has regained particular attention recently because, among other reasons, safety involving self-driving vehicles. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used in this work as classifier in distinct situations: having a single sensor data as input, and by combining data from both sensors in the CNN input layer. Range (distance) and intensity (reflectance) data from LIDAR are considered as separate channels, where data from the LIDAR sensor is feed to the CNN in the form of dense maps, as the result of sensor coordinate transformation and spatial filtering; this allows a direct implementation of the same CNN-based approach on both sensors data. In terms of late-fusion, the outputs from individual CNNs are combined by means of learning and non-learning approaches. Pedestrian classification is evaluated on a 'binary classification' dataset created from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, and results are shown for each sensor-modality individually, and for the fusion strategies.
